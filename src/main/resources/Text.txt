A morbid tragedy about mortality, madness, and murder, Hamlet follows the eponymous Prince of Denmark as he plots to avenge his father’s murder at the hands of Claudius, Hamlet’s uncle and the current king, who married Hamlet’s mother, Gertrude. Haunted by a ghost and arguing with his girlfriend Ophelia, Hamlet struggles to take revenge, as delay and feigned insanity preoccupy him. Rounding out the cast are other famous figures, like Horatio, and Polonius, and of course, the Gravedigger, who finds the skull of “poor Yorick.” Perhaps Shakespeare’s most popular play, Hamlet in all its brilliance and nuance is now accessible to every reader with our Shakescleare modern English translation. Discover and decipher some of the most famous quotes in all of Shakespeare’s works, including “To be or not to be, that is the question,” “brevity is the soul of wit,” and “This above all: to thine ownself be true.”
